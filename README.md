### Overview
I am building a grocery list application that will provide an easy and efficient way to track grocery items. When adding an item to the grocery list it will automatically be sorted and categorized based on an item's category and in-store location within a database. Users will be able to add/save recipes, favorites items and organize their list based on category, allowing for users to customize based on their grocery store's location. 

Instead of having to read through an entire list of grocery items, users will have an organized (by category and in-store location) list on their mobile phone to reference while grocery shopping.

### Features
- Users will be able to add/delete items from list
- Users will be able to manually and auto-categorize & sort items based on category
- Users will be able to login and view a saved list
- Users will be able to add/save a recipe and that recipe's items will be added to their list
